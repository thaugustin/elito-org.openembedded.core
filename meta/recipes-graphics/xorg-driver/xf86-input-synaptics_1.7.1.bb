SUMMARY = "X.Org X server -- synaptics touchpad input driver"

DESCRIPTION = "synaptics is an Xorg input driver for the touchpads from \
Synaptics Incorporated. Even though these touchpads (by default, \
operating in a compatibility mode emulating a standard mouse) can be \
handled by the normal evdev or mouse drivers, this driver allows more \
advanced features of the touchpad to become available."
