Upstream-Status: Pending

This issue is that with C++ compiler process an old version of kernel
header file, coincidently that file has a variable named 'new':

* 'embedded/qkbdtty_qws.cpp' include 'linux/vt.h';
* '/usr/include/linux/vt.h' has below code on SLED-11.x:
    + unsigned int new;

On mostly hosts it has been changed to: new -> newev.
